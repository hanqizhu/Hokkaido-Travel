## A description of the responsive design.

The responsive design is based on the width of the viewport. I have

I have 2 kinds of grid design, and they are all responsive. (In page [Sapporo](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/sapporo.html), [Otara](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/otaru.html), and [Hakodate](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/hakodate.html)):

    First the image divs will become smaller and smaller, then they will change from 3 or 4 items per line to 2 items per line.

Also, the images linked with pages in the home page are also responsive.  

    Similarly, they will become smaller and smaller at first, then they changes from 4 items per line to 2 items per line.

The navigation bar will also change to 2 lines when the viewport width becomes small.

And the font sizes of the text in my pages will be smaller.

In addition, the background image will change when the orientation is landscape.

How my code improves the page:

    My code ensures that user can see clearly of anything, and keep the pages clean and neat.

## A description of where to find uses of grid.

Please find my grid designs in page [Sapporo](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/sapporo.html), [Otara](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/otaru.html), and [Hakodate](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/hakodate.html).

One of them is initially grid of 3, the other is initially grid 4.

I design them based on my number of photos, I also added a div named "Photo Gallery" to indicate it.
