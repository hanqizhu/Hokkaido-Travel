## A description of the responsive design.

The responsive design is based on the width of the viewport. I have

I have 2 kinds of grid design, and they are all responsive. (In page [Sapporo](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/sapporo.html), [Otara](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/otaru.html), and [Hakodate](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/hakodate.html)):

    First the image divs will become smaller and smaller, then they will change from 3 or 4 items per line to 2 items per line.

Also, the images linked with pages in the home page are also responsive.  

    Similarly, they will become smaller and smaller at first, then they changes from 4 items per line to 2 items per line.

The navigation bar will also change to 2 lines when the viewport width becomes small.

And the font sizes of the text in my pages will be smaller.

In addition, the background image will change when the orientation is landscape.

How my code improves the page:

    My code ensures that user can see clearly of anything, and keep the pages clean and neat.

## A description of where to find uses of grid.

Please find my grid designs in page [Sapporo](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/sapporo.html), [Otara](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/otaru.html), and [Hakodate](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/hakodate.html).

One of them is initially grid of 3, the other is initially grid 4. And they are designed to be responsive(Please refer to the first section).

I design them based on my number of photos, I also added a div named "Photo Gallery" to indicate it.

Especially in the page of [Otara](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/otaru.html), the 2 grid designs are combined, so they looked better.

## A description of where to find at least two uses of javaScript and/or jQuery.

1. I used jQuery and javascript to make the slider in the [home page](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/index.html).
  I learned it from [this website](https://www.jssor.com/), but generate the code totally on my own, since it is not very difficult.
  This makes my page look better.

2. I used jQuery to generate a form that user can send me messages. They are at the bottom of each page in the footer.
  I used the action given by Colleen from [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
  This helps because my pages become more interactive with users.

3. I also made the lightbox photo gallery, which is similar to the last assignment. It is applied in each page except the homepage, because the images of this page are linked to the sub pages.
  This both makes my pages look good and interactive.

## Other basic requirements.
All are satisfied.

## Extras

1. Accessibility

2. I used carousel to make a slider in the [home page](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/index.html)

3. I used lightboxes in three pages: [Sapporo](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/sapporo.html), [Otara](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/otaru.html), and [Hakodate](https://hanqizhu.github.io/ResponsiveTest/hakodate.html).

4. As I showed my demo to Colleen, she agrees that I have a good command of designing the grid.
