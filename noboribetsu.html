        	<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
        It was a long trip from Sapporo to Noboribetsu.
        And the experience here was very different.
        Near a crater, this city is known for the hot springs (Japanese: Onsen)

        Volcanic eruption also caused unique scene in Noboribetsu, which is called "the Hell Valley" by local people.
        Ghosts and monsters are parts of culture here, which indicates a bless and protect.
        No matter what its origin is, the most important thing in Noboribetsu must be enjoying the hot springs!
        I highly recommend the Dai-ichi (which means "the best" in Japanese) Takimotokan Hotel as a choice.
        The price was slightly higher, but we experienced hot springs with different functions.
        As well as satisfying service and a solid meal that was much richer than I could ever imagine!.
        There are not many photos of Noboribetsu, because I spent all day long trying various kinds of hot springs and delicious meals in the hotel!
